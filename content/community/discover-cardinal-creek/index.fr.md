![Cardinal Creek](cardinal_creek.jpg)
Cardinal Creek est l'un des derniers trésors naturels à Orléans.
On y trouve un écosystème entier: une variété indigène d'arbres, de plantes et de fleurs nourissent des insectes et des petits animaux, qui parfois attirent de plus gros pédateurs tels que les coyotes.

Le secteur sud du karst où passe le ruisseau a été désigné Zone d'interêt naturel et scientifique par le ministère des resources naturelles de l'Ontario (ZINC).
La totalité du ruisseau a aussi été

Damsel bugs are known as beneficial insects for gardeners, as they eat insects who feast on daisy petals.

![Purple loosestrife](purple_loosestrife.jpg)

Bees pollinating purple loose strife. This plant is native to Europe, and was introduced to North America by bee keepers, due to its abundance of nectar. Overpopulation of the species can cause harm in North America, as the loose strife can wipe out native plants essential to biodiversity. Luckily, there aren’t too many in Cardinal Creek, although they are beautiful!

Pileated woodpeckers. In April, the male pileated woodpecker will make a hole in a tree, to nest its young. The pair stays together on its territory all year, and both parents take care of the eggs. Once the brood is raised, the hole is abandoned, and later houses other songbird species.

![Two green herons](green_herons.jpg)

Two green herons. These birds eat small fish, frogs, other aquatic creatures, and sometimes mice. To attract their prey, they often drop food, insects, or small objects into the water. This method of feeding using tools makes them known as one of the most intelligent bird species in the world.

Mourning dove. This ‘bird of peace’ almost exclusively eats seeds.

![American goldfinch](american_goldfinch.jpg)

American goldfinch (or wild canary). Another granivore, this bird almost exclusively eats seeds as well. The open meadow is its preferred habitat, where it can perch on wildflowers.
